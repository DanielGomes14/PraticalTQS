# Lab 3 - Acceptance testing with Web Automation

## Selenium

Selenium is a framework used to automate tests in  Web Applications. We can easily write tests in a number of popular languages like Python, Java, Ruby and many others, using the Selenium client API. Besides this, as these tests can  sometimes take too long, it also has a feature called the Selenium IDE, where we can record the actions in the web page we want to test, according to the tester, and then easily export the code for the tests, in the programming language we want. In order to clean up our code, we should follow the Page Object Pattern, as it provides cleaner and more readable tests.

## Selenium- Jupiter Extension

"JUnit 5 allows the use of extensions which may provide annotation for dependency injection (as seen previously for *Mockito*). This is usually a more compact and convenient approach. The Selenium-Jupiter extension provides convenient defaults and dependencies resolution to run Selenium tests (WebDriver) on JUnit 5 engine. "
