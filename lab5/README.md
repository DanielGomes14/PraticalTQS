# Lab5 - Behaviour-driven development ( Cucumber in java)

## Cucumber

Cucumber is a testing tool that follows the principles of *behaviour driven development*, allowing the write of tests  that are simple and easy to understand for anyone.  To do so, it makes uses of a `.feature` file, written in the `Gherkin` Programming Language,  where people fill up scenarios that describe the behaviors of the system from the customer's perspective. It usually is used combined with Selenium for the development of front-end and UI tests, so that it makes  these kinds of tests more understandable.
